# Image to Lithophane CLI 

Turn any image into a 3D-printable lithophane! A lithophane is a thin translucent panel that reveals an image when backlit. Features include:
- Convert any common image format (PNG, JPEG, BMP, etc.) to a 3D lithophane model
- Optional decorative frame with customizable dimensions and other options
- Adjustable thickness, resolution, and scaling

## Dependencies
Any C compiler should work. Only depedency is [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb), which is included in `include/`.

## Building
Just clone the repo, cd in and:
```bash
gcc src/main.c -o litho -lm
```

## Usage
Basic usage:
```bash
litho your_image.jpg
```

With options:
```bash
litho your_image.png --frame_width 25 --min_thickness 1.5 --bevel_corners -o output.obj
```

### Options
- `--has_frame`: Add a decorative frame
- `--bevel_corners`: Add beveled corners to the front inside part of the frame
- `--min_thickness <mm>`: Minimum thickness (default: 3.0mm)
- `--max_thickness <mm>`: Maximum thickness (default: 10mm)
- `--frame_width <mm>`: Frame width (default: 25mm)
- `--frame_thickness <mm>`: Frame thickness (default: 25mm)
- `--frame_angle <degrees>`: Frame bevel angle (default: 45Â°)
- `--pixels_per_vertex <n>`: Resolution control (default: 2)
- `--scale <n>`: Overall scale factor (default: 0.25)
- `--flip_x/y/z`: Flip along respective axis

The output is a standard .obj file that you can slice with your favorite 3D printing software!

## Tips
- For best results, use high-contrast images
- Try adjusting `bright_scale` if the contrast looks off
- Lower `pixels_per_vertex` for higher detail (but larger files)
- Print vertically for best layer-wise detail
- PNG recommended for highest quality

## To Do
- Different output formats (STL, 3MF, etc.) (these obj files are really big and slow to slice)
- More frame options
- GUI
    - Possibly a web app
    - Possibly with a renderer for previewing
- Better image preprocessing
- Refactor how faces are added
    - I'm thinking we have an addFace function that can take some combination of vertex positions or vertex indices.
    - For any vertex positions passed, it would search the current vertices and if one is close enough, just use that index for face grouping.
    - It would then return 3 indices for the vertices it chose to make up the face.
    - This lets us create vertices, join them into faces, and give them easier names (via the returned indices) with one call, avoiding the need for elaborate indexing schemes to keep track of previous vertices.
